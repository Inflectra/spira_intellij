# [SpiraTeam](http://www.inflectra.com/SpiraTeam/) Plugin for Intellij
This plugin creates a new tool window you can use to seamlessly view your requirements, tasks and incidents right form IntelliJ. 
You can view basic information about items such as description, priority, workflow status and open up the item in your web browser. 


Unfortunately, this plug-in only works with version 5.0 and above of SpiraTeam. If you have an older version, you need to update in order to use this plug-in.
